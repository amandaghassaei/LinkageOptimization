todo:

(joy)
- make 'real' input curve
(check number of pionts = 50)
- check sensitivity/robustness of fitness function (as per steps 1-3 from below)

(amanda)
- checkweirdness ( check periodic?)

(future)

robustness for fitness function:
1. translation & variance => find centerpoint first and move the centerpoint of the desired curve to the current centerpoint
2. phase => should be covered by finding the distances
3. scale => also do something with the centerpoint, averages

looking at path as if ite were an oval & 
normalizing to the length & width (max x/y deviation)
